### Getting Started

- Head onto your terminal/git bash console and enter the following command:

  - git clone https://github.com/Silavin/sticky-note-vanilla.git

- On VSCode, install the plugin: Live Server by Ritwick Dey

- Start the live server by right clicking the index.html file and Open with Live Server.

Note: Filter will reset whenever you add a new note. I do not judge this as a bug

### Goal

The goal is to check the applicant is able to:
